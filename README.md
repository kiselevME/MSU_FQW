## Proportional case (n = 1):
The code can be found in:
    - `proportional_functions_opt.py`
    - `main_proportional_left.py`
    - `main_proportional_right.py`

#### Commands for running scripts:
- calculation left side of proposition 1: `bash script_proportional_left.bash`;
- calculation right side of proposition 1: `bash script_proportional_right.bash`.

You can also run single calculations, the commands for this can be found in the bash scripts above.


## Stop-loss case (n = 1):
The code can be found in:
    - `main_stoploss_left.py`
    - `main_stoploss_right.py`
    - `stoploss_functions_opt.py`

The code for the stop-loss case may contain bugs. At startup, it is recommended to check the correctness of the calculations.
